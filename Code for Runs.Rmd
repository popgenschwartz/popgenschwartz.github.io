```{r}
#to render site to html file after making changes
rmarkdown::render_site()
#this worked correctly if you get a message saying "Output created: index.html"

##hit ctrl-alt-M to commit changes. Make sure all boxes are checked first. Add a comment, click commit, and then push to github. A box should appear telling you everything has pushed successfully.

#the r version for commiting and pushing files can be really touchy. To do it from the command line, use the following code: 

#go to directory 

#git add .
#git commit
#git push

# you get an error during commit that says it is already running, that is due to the fact that it is running in R. 

#use "rm FILENAME" to get rid of it, and then use the commit command

#be sure to use helpful comments so when you look at the version history, it makes sense
